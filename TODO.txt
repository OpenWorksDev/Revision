Add better validation on register
-----------------------------

Verification api/mail
- use access token field as verification token on register, then generate new token and set "verified": true

When user is registered redirect to /login#verify
Show verify instructions on the login page

Add rate limiting on IP addresses

Add validation system to check whether user is a valid user
by sending them an email with their snowflake which they can't
see until they are validated

Every few hours scan the database for unverified users from
over a certain time period ago to delete them from the database
to help maintain database size and bot attacks

Build new better 404 page

Come up with a very pog name for this project
